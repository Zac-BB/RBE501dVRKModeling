# RBE501dVRKModeling

This project focuses on developing a kinematic model of the Patient Side Manipulator (PSM), a component of the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK), using the Product of Exponentials (PoE) formulation from modern robotics.

The PoE method offers a compact and mathematically robust way to represent the forward kinematics of serial manipulators. Unlike traditional Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters, PoE models the manipulator as a product of exponentials of twist coordinates, providing more flexibility and clarity in handling complex configurations and multiple coordinate frames.

In this project:

    Each joint of the PSM is defined by a screw axis in the space frame.

    The forward kinematics are computed using the matrix exponential of each screw, multiplied in sequence with the manipulatorâ€™s home configuration.

    The resulting transformation maps joint angles to end-effector poses in 3D space.

This modeling approach supports high-precision control and provides a strong foundation for tasks like calibration, motion planning, and real-time teleoperation. It also aligns with modern robotics theory, as taught in advanced robotics courses and used in professional applications.
